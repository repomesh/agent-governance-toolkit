# Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Agent Governance Toolkit project.

## Principles

- **Open participation**: Anyone can contribute, report issues, or propose changes.
- **Transparent decision-making**: Architectural decisions are discussed publicly via GitHub Issues and Discussions.
- **Merit-based advancement**: Maintainer roles are earned through sustained, high-quality contributions.
- **Vendor neutrality goal**: The project is working toward multi-organization maintainership to ensure no single vendor controls the project's direction.

## Roles

### Contributor

Anyone who submits a pull request, files an issue, or participates in discussions. Contributors agree to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com).

### Reviewer

Contributors who have demonstrated familiarity with a specific area of the codebase and consistently provide constructive reviews. Reviewers can approve PRs in their area but cannot merge without maintainer approval.

**Path to Reviewer**: 3+ merged PRs in a specific package or area, active participation in issue triage or code review over 1+ months.

### Maintainer

Maintainers have write access to the repository, can merge PRs, and participate in architectural decisions. Maintainers are responsible for the project's technical direction, release management, and community health.

**Path to Maintainer**: Sustained contribution over 2+ months, including 5+ merged PRs, active issue triage, and demonstrated understanding of the project's architecture and governance scope. Nomination by an existing maintainer, confirmed by consensus among current maintainers.

### Project Lead

The project lead sets overall technical direction, resolves disputes when consensus cannot be reached, and represents the project in external standards bodies and foundation interactions.

## Current Maintainers

See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for the full list of current maintainers, their areas of ownership, and affiliation details.

We are actively working to grow the maintainer group to include contributors from other organizations. If you are interested in becoming a maintainer, start by contributing and engaging with the project. Maintainership is granted via the repository `Maintain` role; a maintainer's approval is required on every pull request before merge.

## Decision-Making

### Day-to-day decisions

Pull requests require approval from at least one maintainer before merge. Maintainers use their judgment on routine changes (bug fixes, documentation, test additions).

### Significant changes

Changes that affect the project's architecture, public API surface, security model, or governance scope are discussed publicly via GitHub Issues before implementation. Any maintainer or contributor can raise a concern. The goal is rough consensus among maintainers.

### Disputes

If maintainers cannot reach consensus, the project lead makes the final decision after considering all perspectives. The rationale is documented in the relevant GitHub Issue.

### Succession Planning

Continuity of maintainership is essential for a foundation-hosted project.

- **Project lead vacancy**: If the project lead steps down or becomes inactive for
  60+ days, the Core Maintainers elect a new project lead by supermajority (2/3)
  vote within 30 days. Until a new lead is confirmed, the longest-serving Core
  Maintainer serves as acting lead.
- **Maintainer vacancy**: If the number of Core Maintainers drops below three,
  remaining maintainers must nominate and confirm a replacement within 30 days.
  No architecture or governance decisions may be made until the minimum of three
  is restored.
- **Emeritus**: Maintainers inactive for 3+ months are moved to Emeritus status
  in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) and lose merge privileges. Emeritus
  maintainers can be reinstated by consensus of current maintainers.
- **Deadlock**: If a supermajority vote on project lead succession results in a
  tie after two rounds of voting, the decision is escalated to the governing
  foundation (if applicable) or resolved by the longest-serving Core Maintainer.

### Conflict of Interest

Maintainers must disclose any financial or employment relationship that could
influence their decisions on project direction, dependency choices, or vendor
integrations. A maintainer with a conflict of interest on a specific decision
must recuse themselves from voting on that decision. Disclosures are noted in
the relevant GitHub Issue or PR.

### Voting Thresholds

| Decision type | Required votes | Quorum |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Routine PR merge | 1 maintainer approval | N/A |
| Architecture / API change | Rough consensus among maintainers | 50% of maintainers |
| New maintainer nomination | Consensus among current maintainers | 50% of maintainers |
| Governance document change | 2 maintainer approvals | N/A |
| Project lead succession | Supermajority (2/3) of maintainers | 75% of maintainers |

## Releases

Releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Any maintainer can propose a release. The release process is documented in [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) and automated via GitHub Actions with trusted publishing and SLSA build provenance.

## Project Charter

The project operates under the [Technical Charter](CHARTER.md), which defines the TSC structure, IP policy, and amendment process for foundation governance.

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to follow the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). Violations can be reported to [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com).

## Security

Security vulnerabilities should be reported via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not through public issues.

## Competition Law

All participants must comply with applicable competition (antitrust) laws. See [ANTITRUST.md](ANTITRUST.md) for guidelines on appropriate discussion topics.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this document require a pull request with approval from at least two maintainers. Significant governance changes (e.g., adding new roles, changing decision processes) should be discussed in a GitHub Issue first.
