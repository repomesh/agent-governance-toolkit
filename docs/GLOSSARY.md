# Glossary

Technical terms used across the Agent Governance Toolkit, its specifications, and architecture decision records.

---

### A

* **Agent Control Specification (ACS)**: The stateless, deterministic, fail-closed policy decision runtime at the core of AGT's policy layer. A Rust core evaluates a complete host-supplied snapshot at intervention points across the agent loop and returns a normalized verdict (allow, warn, deny, escalate, or transform). Vendored into `policy-engine/` as the AGT 5.0 policy layer.
* **Agent Identity**: A cryptographic identity (Ed25519 key pair) that uniquely identifies an agent. Every governance action is tied to a verified identity.
* **Agent OS**: The core governance runtime that hosts the policy engine, lifecycle management, and governance gate. All agent actions pass through Agent OS before execution.
* **AgentMesh**: The trust and coordination layer that handles agent discovery, routing, delegation, and inter-agent communication with cryptographic verification.
* **Audit Trail**: A tamper-evident log of all governance decisions. Each entry is hash-chained to its predecessor, making retroactive modification detectable.

### C

* **Circuit Breaker**: A fault-tolerance pattern that stops forwarding requests to a failing downstream service after a threshold of consecutive failures. Used in Agent SRE to prevent cascading failures across agent networks.
* **CloudEvents**: An open specification (CNCF) for describing event data in a common format. AGT uses CloudEvents as the envelope format for governance events emitted through the GovernanceEventSink.
* **Commitment Anchor**: A cryptographic hash published to an external ledger (append-only log or blockchain) that proves a set of governance decisions existed at a specific point in time.
* **Compliance Framework**: A structured set of regulatory or industry requirements (e.g., OWASP, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, SOC 2) that AGT maps governance controls against.
* **Conformance Test**: A test that verifies an implementation meets the requirements of a formal specification. Each AGT spec includes a conformance test suite using RFC 2119 keywords.

### D

* **Decision BOM (Bill of Materials)**: A structured record attached to every policy decision that captures the inputs, rules evaluated, and outcome. Enables full reproducibility of any governance verdict.
* **Delegation Chain**: An ordered sequence of trust delegations from one agent to another. Each link in the chain is signed, and the chain is validated end-to-end before granting delegated permissions.
* **Delta Engine**: A component in Agent Hypervisor that computes minimal diffs between consecutive governance states, enabling efficient replication and audit without transmitting full snapshots.
* **Deterministic Policy Enforcement**: A system that ensures rules are applied exactly as written, with no ambiguity. If a rule says "No Shell Access", the system blocks it every single time.

### E

* **Execution Ring**: One of four privilege levels (Ring 0 through Ring 3) in Agent Runtime that controls what resources and operations an agent can access. Ring 0 is most privileged (system-level), Ring 3 is least privileged (sandboxed).
* **Execution Sandboxing**: A security mechanism for isolating running agents. Creates a constrained environment where an agent can operate without affecting other agents or the host system.

### F

* **Fail-Closed**: A design principle where the system denies the action when the policy engine cannot reach a decision (timeout, error, missing policy). The opposite of fail-open, which would allow the action by default.
* **Framework Adapter**: A thin integration layer that connects a third-party agent framework (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.) to AGT's governance pipeline. Adapters implement the Framework Adapter Contract specification.

### G

* **Governance Event**: A structured record emitted when a policy decision occurs. Contains the decision outcome, policy references, agent identity, timestamp, and Decision BOM.
* **GovernanceEventSink**: A pluggable interface for routing governance events to external systems (OpenTelemetry, SIEM, databases, message queues). Follows the structural typing pattern defined in ADR-0025.
* **Governance Gate**: The synchronous checkpoint in Agent OS that intercepts every agent action, evaluates it against active policies, and returns allow/deny before the action executes.

### H

* **Hash Chain**: See *Merkle Chain*.

### I

* **IATP (Identity and Trust Protocol)**: A protocol for establishing and verifying agent identity across organizational boundaries. Used by AgentMesh for cross-domain trust federation.
* **Intervention Point**: One of the eight points across the agent loop (input, model call, tool call, tool result, output, and their pre/post variants) where the Agent Control Specification runtime evaluates a snapshot and returns a verdict.

### K

* **Kill Switch**: An Agent SRE mechanism that immediately halts a specific agent or group of agents. Can be triggered manually, by SLO violations, or by anomaly detection. Takes effect within the SLA-defined time window.

### M

* **Merkle Chain**: A data structure where each audit record contains a cryptographic hash of the previous record, forming a tamper-evident chain. If any record is modified, all subsequent hashes become invalid.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: An open protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. AGT's MCP Security Gateway adds governance controls (policy checks, trust verification, rate limiting) to MCP tool calls.
* **Middleware**: A software layer that sits between the AI agent and the tools it uses. Intercepts actions to check if they are allowed before execution proceeds.

### O

* **OpenTelemetry (OTel)**: An open observability framework for traces, metrics, and logs. AGT uses OTel as a primary backend for GovernanceEventSink, enabling governance telemetry to flow into existing observability infrastructure.

### P

* **Policy**: A declarative rule that defines what an agent is allowed or denied from doing. Policies specify target agents (by identity, role, or trust score), target actions, and conditions.
* **Policy Linting**: Static analysis of policy definitions to detect conflicts, unreachable rules, shadowed permissions, and logical errors before deployment.
* **Policy Merge**: The process of combining multiple policies from different sources (organization, team, agent-level) into a single effective policy set, with defined precedence rules.

### R

* **RL Training Governance**: Controls in Agent Lightning that apply governance to reinforcement learning training loops. Includes violation penalties, reward shaping constraints, and training checkpoint verification.
* **Rollback**: The process of reverting an agent or policy to a previously known-good state. Agent SRE automates rollback when post-deployment SLO checks fail.

### S

* **SLO (Service Level Objective)**: A target for agent reliability or performance (e.g., "policy evaluation latency under 50ms at p99"). Agent SRE monitors SLOs and triggers alerts or kill switches on violations.
* **Structural Typing**: A type compatibility approach where an object satisfies an interface if it has the required methods, regardless of explicit inheritance. Used for GovernanceEventSink to allow any compatible object to serve as a sink without inheriting a base class.

### T

* **Transform Verdict**: An Agent Control Specification verdict that instructs the host to replace the value under evaluation (for example, to redact tool output) instead of allowing or denying it outright. Replaces the "effects" concept from upstream ACS in the AGT variant.
* **Trust Ceiling**: The maximum trust score an agent can achieve, regardless of its behavior. Set by organizational policy to cap the privileges any single agent can accumulate.
* **Trust Score**: A dynamic rating (0-1000) assigned to an agent based on its behavior history, verification status, and organizational policies. Higher scores grant access to more sensitive operations.
* **Trust Scoring**: The process of computing and updating an agent's trust score based on governance events, compliance history, and peer attestations.

### V

* **Verdict**: The normalized decision returned by the Agent Control Specification runtime for an intervention point: one of allow, warn, deny, escalate, or transform, optionally with a low-cardinality reason code, host-facing message, transform body, and evidence.

### Z

* **Zero-Trust Identity**: A security model where no agent is trusted by default. Every agent must prove its identity using cryptographic keys for every action, regardless of network location or prior history.

### OWASP Agentic Security Issues

* **Goal Hijacking (ASI-01)**: When an attacker tricks an AI agent into ignoring its original instructions to follow new, malicious ones.
* **Tool Misuse (ASI-02)**: When an agent uses a tool in a way that was not intended, potentially causing damage or data loss.
* **Privilege Escalation (ASI-03)**: When an agent gains access to resources or permissions beyond what its policies allow.
* **Exfiltration (ASI-06)**: The unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from within the system to an external location controlled by an attacker.
